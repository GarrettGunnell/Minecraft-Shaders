# Minecraft Shaders
by Garrett Gunnell

An exploration of Optifine's rendering pipeline and modifying it to improve the overall appearance of Minecraft. 

# Disclaimer: 
These shaders are not meant to be played with and do not work for most in game scenarios such as being in dimensions other than the overworld or being underwater. I also do not intend on making them playable, use cooler looking shaders instead.

## Effects:
* Diffuse Lighting
* Soft Shadows
* Contrast/Brightness
* Saturation
* Sharpness
* Bloom
* Screenspace Fog
* ACES Tone Mapping
* Gamma Correction

## Examples:
